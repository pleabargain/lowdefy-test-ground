## next step
Get the chart to display real time temp data from X country.

## Axios nunchuck connection error: FIXED
Check out the correct config in the nunchuck.yaml file to connect to the Github repo list. 
Next step will be to play with pagination options.


Jon helped get nunchuck to play nice. Thanks Jon!


## NEW error on connecting books.yaml to glitch.me
Tried to reproduce the same Axios connection params but with a different API. No joy.
